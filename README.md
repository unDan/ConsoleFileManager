# Console File Manager
### ***Description***
This is a simple Console File Manager that allows you simply manage your files.
This project is still under development, so description may be updated from time to time.
For now, the features that are already realized:
* You can configurate how the application looks in the console: background color, foreground color, symbol to draw window borders with, amount of files shown per page.
* Application saves its state just before the exit. So you can continue your work when you start the application again.
* A log file is created for any occured error that can not be handled by user. So you always can try to figure out what went wrong.
* You can browse your files, copy them, delete them or get information about them.


### ***Commands (general information)***
Here are all commands that are currently available in the application:
